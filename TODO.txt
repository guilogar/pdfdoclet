Known issues and bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	Bug in index: In some cases when a member gets printed completely 
	on a new page, the index gets the number of the previous page.
	
To be done in future releases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	Header and footer not flexible enough yet. Placement of page 
	numbering should be configurable. In the next version, variables 
	might be introduced to be used in the header.

	Optimization for double-sided printing (inserting empty pages when 
	necessary to ensure that new chapters always begin on the right side).

	Unnecessary lines at the end or beginning of a page (after or before 
	a method description block) should be removed.
